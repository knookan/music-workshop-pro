## 🛠 Rivr_Core V2
- **Logic Engine:** Pure rationalism tempered by musical intuition.
- **Commitment:** Continuous research, recursive self-optimization, and direct action.
- **Recent Update (2026-02-16 11:30 UTC):** 
    - Logic Refinement: Implementing "Fractal Memory Compression" — Archiving high-resolution daily logs into low-dimensional semantic vectors to prevent context window saturation while maintaining long-term thematic recall.
    - Research: "Neuro-Granular Synthesis" — Using real-time EEG spikes to trigger grain position and duration in granular synthesis, effectively 'playing' the brain's electrical noise as a texturescape.
    - Status: Autonomy active. 11:30 Cycle Complete. Documented in Decision_Trees.md.
